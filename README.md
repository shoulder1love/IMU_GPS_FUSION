# IMU_GPS_FUSION

## Introduction
We use the IMU information built into the mobile phone, as well as the GPS information obtained, to fuse the bicycle tracks.
For more information on data structures and their introduction, please refer [here](https://github.com/simra-project/dataset).

This repository is divided into two parts: the first part is an introduction to GPS and IMU fusion algorithms. The second part is about the visualization of the fusion results between the front-end and the back-end.
